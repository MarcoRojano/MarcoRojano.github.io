### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

        Lab 3, part 1 was my favorite because I learned how to accurately measure the BMI of a person. I was able to practice writing functions for the first time. I also learned how to make an input and an output to collect one's weight and give an estimation of the calories burned.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorites becaues we learned how to code, how to find the area of a rectangle. We declare and variables and initialized them. We then also find the area of a triangle and declared an also deal with inputs and outputs.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorites because of the difficulty of the assignemt. We discuss how to find the population of states We integrated while loops. We had to initialize the land area and population of the states then give an output to confirm the number of each.
